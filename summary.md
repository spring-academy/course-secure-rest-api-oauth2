##### What you'll learn

## Spring Security has your back

From security-first defaults to unlimited customization, Spring Security is the most powerful package for securing your Spring Boot API with OAuth 2.0. But how do you actually use Spring Security, and how do you know when _not_ to configure anything at all and just let Spring Security do it for you?
