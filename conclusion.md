You did it!

In this course, you have accomplished a lot. You now should have a better understanding of the following:

- How to develop a secure REST API
- How to authenticate with JWTs, with or without an authorization server
- How to authorize requests, method calls, and database queries and when to use each
- How to model authorization relative to REST semantics
- Where and why Spring Security encourages practices like Secure by Default, Principle of Least Privilege, and Favoring Composition over Inheritance, and
- What is some of the underlying structure of Spring Security, like its usage of the Servlet API

We hope you've enjoyed the growing and stretching process of learning from Spring experts!
