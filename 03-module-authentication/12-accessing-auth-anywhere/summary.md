The `SecurityContextHolder` in Spring Security serves as a central access point for retrieving and managing the user's security context in a web application. By using this component, you can conveniently perform authentication and authorization checks at different stages of request processing. It simplifies the handling of security-related information and ensures thread-safe access to the user's security context throughout the application.
