Spring Security and Spring MVC provides multiple ways to access authentication information in your web application. The `Authentication` method parameter type allows direct access to the authentication object. The `@CurrentSecurityContext` annotation grants access to the entire security context, providing a comprehensive view of the authentication and other security-related information; remember that it provides the use of SpEL, type conversion and meta-annotations. Finally, the `@AuthenticationPrincipal` annotation is suitable for extracting type-specific information from the principal, and you can see it as an alias of the `@CurrentSecurityContext(expression = "authentication.principal")`.

By leveraging these mechanisms, you can implement secure and personalized features based on the user's authentication details in your Spring MVC application.

Now let's take a look at each of these in practice.
