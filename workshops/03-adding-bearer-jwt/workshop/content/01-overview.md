In this lab, you'll replace the Spring Security default HTTP Basic with OAuth 2.0 Bearer JWT Authentication.

Remember that using OAuth 2.0 terminology, this will turn your REST API into an **OAuth 2.0 Resource Server**, so you'll see that term used throughout this lab. However, since we do not yet have an authorization server, a JWT is provided for you as if it had been issued from an authorization server. We'll integrate with a real Authorization Server later on.
