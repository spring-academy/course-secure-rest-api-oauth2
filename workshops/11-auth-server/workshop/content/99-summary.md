In this lab, you learned how to integrate an Authorization Server into your Cash Cards project.

You removed the locally-configured public key for token validation and instead relied on the external authorization server for token issuance.

You also updated your YAML configuration to point to the Authorization Server and started the Authorization Server by using a Docker image.

Finally, you were able to obtain a token from the Authorization Server and use it to get your cash cards.

That was quite a journey!
