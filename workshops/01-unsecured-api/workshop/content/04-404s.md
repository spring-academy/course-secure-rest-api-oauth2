Next, request `/a-non-existent-endpoint` in the Terminal, like so:

```bash
[~/exercises] $ http :8080/a-non-existent-endpoint
```

You should see a `404 Not Found` error since `/a-non-existent-endpoint` doesn't exist.

```json
{
  "error": "Not Found",
  "path": "/a-non-existent-endpoint",
  "status": 404,
  "timestamp": "..."
}
```

Once again -- what's the big deal?

While a `404 Not Found` isn't a bad thing, when left unsecured like this, it can lead to [Fingerprinting](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/02-Fingerprint_Web_Server), [Directory Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal) and other [enumeration-like vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/04-Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account).

Remember this behavior as we move to the next module and learn about [Spring Security's defaults](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/getting-started.html#servlet-hello-auto-configuration).
