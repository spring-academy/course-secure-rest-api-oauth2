In this lab, you're going to see how a simple Spring Boot REST API behaves before adding Spring Security. This will help you better understand Spring Security's secure defaults and why they are important.

This knowledge will also help you to apply this _secure-by-default_ philosophy more broadly when coding applications in general.

**_Note:_** The codebase for this lab does not have Spring Security on the classpath; it will be added in another lab.
