In this lab, you learned how to customize failure processing by creating a custom `AuthenticationEntryPoint` implementation.

While this labs may have felt a little like a stretch, consider what you've achieved:

- You've customized failure processing
- You've added more error detail to help out the client, and
- You've used the Problem Detail standard for transmitting those errors

You also learned that Spring Security favors composition over inheritance and that you can use Spring Framework components.

That's some advanced stuff!
